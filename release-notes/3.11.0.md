## Highlights



## Obtaining Packages

RabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases), [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~rabbitmq/repos/), and [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq).


### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 24.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later. Erlang 25 is recommended,
in particular when running on ARM64-based CPUs.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains what package repositories and tools
can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 24.3.x and 25.x.



## Upgrading to 3.11

### Documentation guides on upgrades

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html)
for release notes of other releases.

### Required

RabbitMQ 3.11.0 [will require all feature flags introduced in RabbitMQ 3.8 to be enabled](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/07/required-feature-flags-in-rabbitmq-3.11/)
before upgrading. If that is not the case, the upgrade process will not proceed.

### Mixed version cluster compatibility

RabbitMQ 3.11.0 nodes can run alongside `3.10.x` nodes. `3.11.x`-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster
upgrade to 3.11.0 or any other patch release in the series.

While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes is covered below.
Once all nodes are upgraded to 3.10.0, these irregularities will go away.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended
periods of time (no more than a few hours).



## Compatibility Notes

###

RabbitMQ 3.11.0 will [require all feature flags from the 3.8.x release series to be enabled](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/07/required-feature-flags-in-rabbitmq-3.11/) before upgrading.
If the feature flags are not enabled, RabbitMQ 3.11 and later nodes will refuse to start.

### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

Starting with this release, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25.0 or later versions. Nodes **will fail to start**
on older Erlang releases.

Erlang 25 as our new baseline means much improved performance on ARM64 architectures, [profiling with flame graphs](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/)
across all architectures, and the most recent TLS 1.3 implementation available to all RabbitMQ 3.11 users.

### Open File Handle Limit is Capped by Default

Nodes now default to 65536 concurrent client connections instead of using the effective kernel open file handle limit.


This change was introduced because of a change in several Linux distributions: they now use a default open file handle limit so high,
they cause a significant (say, 1.5 GiB) memory preallocated the Erlang runtime.

For example, [RHEL 9 and CentOS Stream 9](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1479623) are examples of such distributions.
The new default [comes from modern systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/a8b627aaed409a15260c25988970c795bf963812).

See [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#5684](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5684) and [docker-library/rabbitmq#545](https://github.com/docker-library/rabbitmq/issues/545#issuecomment-1224977154)
for details.

### Client Library Compatibility

Client libraries that were compatible with RabbitMQ `3.10.x` will be compatible with `3.11.0`.

## Changes Worth Mentioning

Release notes are kept under [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.11.x/release-notes).

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * Some features flags have [graduated to always enabled](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/07/required-feature-flags-in-rabbitmq-3.11/).
   This means that they must be enabled before upgrading to 3.11. If that is not the case, the upgrade process will not proceed.

 * More efficient connection tracking. This means less CPU load in environments where high [connection churn](https://www.rabbitmq.com/connections.html#high-connection-churn)
   cannot be avoided.

   In part contributed by @gomoripeti.

   GitHub issue: [#5610](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5610)

 * 10% to 20% throughput gain for publishers that use the default exchange.

   GitHub issue: [#4606](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4606)

#### Bug Fixes

 * Durable classic queues could get "lost" under certain conditions when a node failed.

   GitHub issue: [#4563](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4563)

 * Nodes could get stuck when performing a rolling restart on Kubernetes where DNS hostname
   resolution was not available early on node boot.
   For example, this is the case with a [popular default caching setting of CoreDNS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#stable-network-id).

   GitHub issue: [#5438](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5438)


### Stream Plugin

#### Enhancement

 * RabbitMQ now supports [partitioned streams](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/07/rabbitmq-3-11-feature-preview-super-streams/) (super streams).
   Super streams are a way to scale out by partitioning a large stream into smaller streams.

 * Stream protocol clients and RabbitMQ nodes now have a mechanism of exchanging
   their capabilities (sets of supported commands).

   GitHub issue: [#5308](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/5308)

 * New stream protocol command that allows certain stream metadata to be inspected by
   applications.

   GitHub issue: [#5412](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/5412)

 * [Single Active Consumer support for streams](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/07/rabbitmq-3-11-feature-preview-single-active-consumer-for-streams/).

   GitHub issue: [#3754](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3754)

 * Consumers now have access to their committed offset information.

   GitHub issue: [#5307](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/5307)


### OAuth 2 AuthN/AuthZ Backend Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * OAuth 2 plugin now [supports more identity providers and OpenID Connect](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/07/oidc-integration/).

   GitHub issue: [#4749](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4749)

 * OAuth 2 plugin now supports [Rich Authorization Requests](https://oauth.net/2/rich-authorization-requests/).

   GitHub issue: [#5234](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5234)

### Management Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Management UI OAuth 2 integration supports more identity providers and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/).

   GitHub issue: [#4749](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4749)

 * HTTP API responses that render a large rest sets are now more efficient thanks to a more efficient JSON serialiser library used internally.
   Peak memory footprint of such queries is also double digit percent lower compared to v3.10.x.

   GitHub issue: [#5356](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5356)

 * New endpoint for listing connections of a specific user.

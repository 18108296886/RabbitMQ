RabbitMQ `3.9.7` is a maintenance release in the `3.9.x` release series.

Please refer to the **Upgrading to 3.9** section from [v3.9.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.9.0) if upgrading from a version prior to 3.9.0.

This release requires at least Erlang 23.2, and supports the latest Erlang 24 version, 24.0.5 at the time of release. [RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.



## Changes Worth Mentioning

Release notes are kept under [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.9.x/release-notes).
Contributors are encouraged to update them together with their changes. This helps with release automation and a more consistent release schedule.

### All Components

  * All bytecode is now compiled using the `+deterministic` compiler flag. This should eliminate the capture of some irrelevant build environment attributes in produced artifacts, improve consistency between builds, and reduce the file level diff between release artifacts.

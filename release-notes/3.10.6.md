### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * Stream metric collection is now more CPU efficient. It helps in environments that
   have many streams.

   GitHub issue: [#4950](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4950)

 * Optimization: internal message GUID is no longer generated for quorum queues and streams, as they
   are specific to classic queues.

   GitHub issue: [#4990](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4990)

 * Two more AMQP 1.0 connection lifecycle events are now logged.

   GitHub issue: [#4982](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4982)

 * TLS configuration for inter-node stream replication connections now can
   use function references and definitions.

   GitHub issue: [#4991](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4991)

 * Stream protocol connection logging is now less verbose.

   GitHub issue: [#5037](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5037)

 * Max stream segment size is now limited to 3 GiB to avoid a potential stream position overflow.

   GitHub issue: [#5020](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5020)

 * Stream coordinator warnings now include operation name for clarify.

   GitHub issue: [#5036](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5036)

 * Logging messages that use microseconds now use "us" for the SI symbol to be compatible with more
   tools.

   GitHub issue: [#5125](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5125)

#### Bug Fixes

 * Channels on connections to mixed clusters that had 3.8 nodes in them could run into
   an exception.

   GitHub issue: [#5141](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/5141)

 * Inter-node cluster link statistics did not have any data when TLS was enabled for them.

   GitHub issue: [#4981](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4981)

 * Quorum queues now correctly propagate errors when a `basic.get` (polling consumption) operation hits
   a timeout.

   GitHub issue: [#5107](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5107)

 * Stream consumer that used AMQP 0-9-1 instead of a stream protocol client, and disconnected,
   leaked a file handle.

   GitHub issue: [#5085](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5085)

 * Max frame size and client heartbeat parameters for [RabbitMQ stream]() clients were not correctly
   set when taken from `rabbitmq.conf`.

   GitHub issue: [#5131](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5131)

 * Removed a duplicate exchange decorator set operation.

   Contributed by Péter @gomoripeti Gömöri.

   GitHub issue: [#4962](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4962)


### Consistent Hashing Exchange Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Node restarts could result in a hashing ring inconsistency.

   This required a **potentially breaking change**: this exchange type
   now only allows for **one binding between an exchange and a queue** (or another exchange).
   All subsequent binding operations between them will be ignored, so "first write wins".

   This is a natural topology for this plugin, and enforcing it helps avoid a set of
   potential issues with concurrent node restarts and client operations that affect
   consistent hash ring state.

   GitHub issue: [#3386](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3386)

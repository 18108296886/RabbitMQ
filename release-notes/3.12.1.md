RabbitMQ `3.12.1` is a maintenance release in the `3.12.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html).

Please refer to the upgrade section from the [3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0)
if upgrading from a version prior to 3.12.0.

This release requires Erlang 25 and supports Erlang versions up to `26.0.x`.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

As of 3.12.0, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

Users upgrading from 3.11.x (or older releases) on Erlang 25 to 3.12.x on Erlang 26
(both RabbitMQ *and* Erlang are upgraded at the same time) **must** consult
the [v3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0) first.


## Changes Worth Mentioning

Release notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.12.x/release-notes).

### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Classic queues v1 (CQv1) that had a backlog of messages stored by 3.9 and earlier versions
   could run into an exception during queue index recovery after an upgrade to 3.10.x or any later series.

   CQv2 and queues without a backlog were not affected.

### OAuth 2 Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * The plugin will now accept JWT tokens without a `scope`. Such tokens would only be useful when the plugin
   is used exclusively for authentication and not authorization.

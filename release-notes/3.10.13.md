RabbitMQ `3.10.13` is a maintenance release in the `3.10.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html).

Please refer to the upgrade section from [v3.10.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.10.0)
if upgrading from a version prior to 3.10.0.

This release requires Erlang 24.2 and supports Erlang 25.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

Erlang 23 support has reached its [end of support](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html).

This release of RabbitMQ requires Erlang 24.2 or later versions. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

Erlang 25 is recommended: it offers much improved performance on ARM64 architectures, [profiling with flame graphs](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/)
across all architectures, and the most recent TLS 1.3 implementation.

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * When both `disk_free_limit.relative` and `disk_free_limit.absolute`,
   or both `vm_memory_high_watermark.relative` and `vm_memory_high_watermark.absolute` are set,
   the absolute settings will now take precedence.

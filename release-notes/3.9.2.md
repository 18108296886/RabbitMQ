# RabbitMQ 3.9.2

RabbitMQ `3.9.2` is a maintenance release in the `3.9.x` release series. [This is what changed since v3.9.1](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/compare/v3.9.1...v3.9.2).

Please refer to the **Upgrading to 3.9** section from [v3.9.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.9.0) if you are upgrading from a version prior to 3.9.0.

This release requires at least Erlang 23.2, and supports the latest Erlang 24 version, 24.0.5 at the time of release. [RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


## Changes Worth Mentioning

The source of truth for all release notes is now in [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.9.2/release-notes). This will allow all contributors to add a summary of their changes to the release notes, part of the change that they contribute. We are doing this so that the RabbitMQ release process can be fully automated. Currently, compiling the release notes is a manual step, and it happens part of the release process. If we "shift left" and make this activity part of the changes themselves, the only manual step that will be left is clicking a button in our CI/CD system. That is easy to automate, so maybe we can start producing patch releases on a regular schedule, e.g. every `n` weeks.
